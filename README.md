### Architecture

![Architecture of infrastructure used](Blank diagram.png)
___
I have used the JWT for security but for the ease of use and to test the functionality of the API, 
I have intentionally made all endpoints open (not secured). 

The client and contracting Institution accounts and wallets have been pregenerated so that payment of contents made can be settled accordingly.

To be able to pay for product there would be need to register a content creator whose products can be purchased on the platform.
